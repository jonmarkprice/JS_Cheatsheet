/* Starting now I will be categorizing rules by properties (font size, color, etc.)
  instead of element */

/* background color */
ul {background-color: #F3F3F3;}

/* The problem with using these pseudoselectors instead of surrounding
  the the <li> content with a <span> is that we then can't use background
  color very well. (it acts like a text-highlight rather than a block 
  background).

  Another problem, as I had before is that an empty list still takes a whole
  line.
